    "robot_description2": "When the Stardroids led a conquest on Earth, Venus waited in his lair to face Mega Man in battle. He mainly focused on attacking with the Bubble Bomb, an explosive bomb that was covered in a water bubble, which proved to be a powerful and unexpected weapon and later inspired the creation of Burst Man. Leave it to the Stardroids to set trends with unique and strange weapons! He's also made out of a sturdy material designed to handle explosives, and can take what he can dish out. Much like a crab, Venus can only walk sideways, not forward, which honestly makes him look a bit hilarious when walking. Don't make fun of him for it though, as he's an extremely aggressive robot. This guy would probably kick a puppy if he had the chance! He also loves cleanliness, going so far to wash his head despite having a lack of hair. Despite being an alien robot, Venus is clearly a robot inspired by something crab-like....which could mean Crustaceans exist elsewhere in the universe too? With such a short temper and his plethora of explosives, Venus isn't a guy to tick off!",
