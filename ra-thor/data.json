However, Ra Sigma appears to have been reanimated by someone other than our usual suspect. The \"Sigma\" power that has resurrected this robot is curiously non-celestial, but it would be unwise to discount our antagonists' involvement in its genesis. The circumstances of Ra Sigma's birth notwithstanding, it cannot be a coincidence that it bears a striking resemblance to the exhumed robot masters it fights alongside. Cold, uncaring, and unrelenting in its attacks, Ra Sigma is not a force to be underestimated in battle. Despite its empty core, its powers are decidedly elemental in nature. With the ability to manipulate and absorb nearby core shields with ease, Ra Sigma is a formidable opponent.",
