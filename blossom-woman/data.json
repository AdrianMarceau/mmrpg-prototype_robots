    "robot_description2": "Blossom Woman is based on an early design by Dr. Wily, and may have made it to production had Wily not abducted Plant Man instead several months later. Blossom Woman would have served a similar purpose to Plant Man, but would have also been able to communicate with both plant and insect life. This concept was later revisited by Dr. Light in his design for a \"Honey Woman,\" which eventually became Hornet Man. Naturally, Blossom Woman's design seems to be based off both a flower and possibly a praying mantis or similar insect.",
