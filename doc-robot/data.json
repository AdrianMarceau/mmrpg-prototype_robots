With his army running low and the stakes running higher, the ace up the madman\u2019s sleeve was the Diverse Operations Circuit Robot - codified as Doc Robot K-176. Doc Robot was developed as an economical alternative to test multiple different Robot Master systems, and like Mega Man, it has the adaptable capability to take on the ability of other robots by switching its program data. With the endless arsenal of the Prototype database then, this killing machine has all that it needs to ensure nothing less than absolute destruction of its target. Don\u2019t be fooled by its demeanor and words, either - it is little more than a beast, pretending at having the conscience of man, utilizing auto-generated artificial intelligence to get what it wants. And what it wants is data; the Doc Robot is highly territorial, ferally fixated on infinitely amassing data and information for its own personal collection. If all it understands is the power of robots Mega Man was able to beat before, however - that means it can be beaten again!",
