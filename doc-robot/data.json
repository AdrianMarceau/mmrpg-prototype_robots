    "robot_description2": "In the midst of Dr. Wily's hidden scheme to eventually steal the gigantic peacekeeping robot known as \"Gamma\", the maniacal scientist decided that he needed to find a way to buy himself more time and still appear as if he was still a good samaritan to his good-hearted partner, Dr. Light. With his army running low and the stakes running higher, Dr. Wily employed the Diverse Operations Circuits Robot, otherwise known as Doc Robot, to distract Mega Man while Wily finished the last workings of his plan. Due to limited sources and weapons to draw upon, Doc Robot was built only with his hefty size and a Copy Chip containing just enough memory for one weapon configuration data, but relied on a unique adaptation programming that allowed it to quickly counter Mega Man's strategies. In terms of personality though, Doc Robot never had one installed, leaving it single-minded on its purpose. While this limits its decision-making abilities and thought process, it also lets Doc Robot function as an intimidating force to all it encounters, being a literal fighting machine. As far as robots with the ability to copy others go, Doc Robot is unorthodox; but that doesn't make it any less dangerous.",
