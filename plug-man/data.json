He was designed to test the quality control in a television factory, although he's more notably known for being an unwilling facet in Dr. Wily's expiration date plot. Plug Man's main weapon is the Plug Ball, a small, round electric-based ball that can scurry on surfaces that aren't even conductive! Yet, despite his electrical capabilities, Plug Man simply doesn't have the heart of a fighter compared to his electrical counterpart, Elec Man; he's certainly much more into the casual aspects of life in Mega City. He's obsessed with electronic stores, and an connoisseur of various shonen and slice-of-life animes. He's also not afraid about talking with his friends about geeky subjects, and he also seems to be good friends with Bright Man. Despite being a bit odd, he's an incredibly nice person to know and chat with. And, if you likely ask him nicely enough, he'd probably be willing to power your TV for you!",
