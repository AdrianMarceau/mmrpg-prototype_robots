Now that you're aware of this, that should make Hard Man all the more imposing when it's revealed his body is almost entirely composed out of the stuff! With his Ceratanium composition, his body is nigh invincible and impervious to damage, and to say nothing about how he hits with that armor! While that does form an inherent flaw in his mobility, Dr. Wily managed to cleverly circumvent his range issue with the Hard Knuckle weapon, where Hard Man's fists are actually rocket-propelled off his body to strike his opposition from afar. It's a dastardly tactic, but it's weighed out by the fact that Hard Man himself is a rather fair-minded and honest individual. While admittedly somewhat of a lazy bones, his primary battle tactic is to always ensure that he and his opponent are on equal ground, obviously before the inevitable result where he humiliatingly crushes his foe in fair combat. However, this mindset puts the forthright giant at odds with the more pragmatic Snake Man. Aside from his work, Hard Man's main hobby is Sumo Wrestling, and he has a fear of water after being pushed into a swimming pool by Snake Man. Those two are just never gonna get along...",
