After venturing further inside \u201cProto Man's\" castle, Mega Man was confronted with one of these robots: Dark Man 2. He is similar in size and stature to his brethren, but is colored in a dark grey and lacks a buster, unlike the other Dark Men. Rather than shooting the opponent down, Dark Man 2 commands two electrical shields to do his bidding. These barriers revolve around Dark Man 2 as he moves, but he only seems to walk back and forth. Perhaps jumping disables the magnetic bond, disabling his only attack. Then again, the shields seem to be lacking in their offensive and defensive capabilities anyways, due to the fact there are two margins during the barrier cycle that you can shoot through his defenses. Maybe Dark Man 2 isn\u2019t exactly the best his series has to offer\u2026.",
