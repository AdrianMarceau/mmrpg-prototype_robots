Of course, as with anything with Wily's name on it, he was promptly utilized in matters most nefarious. He can specifically launch the aptly-named \"Magnet Missiles\" to close and home in on any robot, guaranteeing utmost precision with the usage of ferromagnetic wavelengths! And, to further cement his distance-controlling tactics and strategies, Magnet Man's also capable of acting as a functioning magnetic generator, drawing in attracted adversaries to annihilate them in a brief barrage of close-combat firing. All in all, Magnet Man is an avant-garde aficionado when it comes to the turmoils of war, the utter epitome of a forward-thinking tactician and a remarkable leader. Yet, he is rather abrasive and without a commander like Dr. Wily to order him on, he does lack a sense of direction. Also, even though he's a robot, Magnet Man's been suffering from stiffness in his joints lately, so he's been scheduling weekly appointments with a proper chiropractor, specifically dealing in magnetic therapy and massages! Moving beyond Magnet Man's medical history, he's a phenomenal tactician with an admirable sense of seriousness!... But, it is awfully hard to take him seriously with the goofy magnet on his head, isn't it?",
