This new opponent already provides a higher difficulty compared to his two previous brothers: this one can jump and shoot! Dark Man 3 is colored a deep shade of purple and equipped with a large arm cannon, but he still uses a glass cranium and a visor, like Dark Men 1 and 2. Dark Man 3 leaps high in the air and rains volleys of five shots down on enemies. That bulky buster he holds can also shoot three small projectiles that can disrupt an opponent\u2019s energy, freezing them where they stand, slide, or \u2026 jump? However, despite his great jumping height, Dark Man 3 seems to struggle while moving on the ground, jerking a small distance forward and stopping immediately after. A weapon to hit him while he is airborne may also be useful. Either way, try not to get frozen, or Dark Man 3 will get some target practice on you.",
