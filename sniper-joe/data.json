Light and Wily, based heavily on the schematics of the prior Proto Man.  The large shields that Sniper Joe bring into battle protect them from nearly all damage, but they can be reliably knocked-off with a sufficiently charged buster shot or a weapon of either the Explode or Impact variety.  More inventive in its programming than any other Mecha, the Sniper Joe is advanced enough to enact adaptable strategy routines, wield shields and firepower, or command vehicles. Despite there being thousands of this model, they are indeed all named 'Joe.'",
