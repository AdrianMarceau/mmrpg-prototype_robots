With a dull whistle and powerful buster, the oddly conspicuous Proto Man almost had Mega Man beat. However, in a nick of time, the real Proto Man suddenly appeared and revealed his impostor's true form: Dark Man 4. Serving as the leader for the Dark Men series, this iteration is colored red and has pointed feet and shoulder pads. Adapting the weaponry his brethren uses, Dark Man 4 has the buster of Dark Man 1, the electric shields of Dark Man 2, and most impressively, the ability to jump from Dark Man 3! He uses all three of the Dark Men's weapons in conjunction to overwhelm enemies, but arguably not to their fullest potential. Dark Man 4 also lack some defensive prowess, taking serious damage from Dr. Cossack's Beat. However, of all of Dark Man 4's vices, his absolute biggest weakness is his music! It's astonishing anybody felt those haphazardly combined notes resembled Proto Man's whistle!",
