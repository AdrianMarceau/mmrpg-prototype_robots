The Heel-Bots appear to feature all the same capabilities of their sibling Heal-Bots, though curiously their healing matrixes have been completely destabilized and fried. They're nowhere near as innocent, either; they can be seen loitering, leaving shopping carts in the  parking lot, and not using their turn signals when turning. In other words, absolute evil.",
