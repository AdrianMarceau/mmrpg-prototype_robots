What is known is that the Trille-Bot possess an incredible amount of alien energy brimming within their cores.  Trille-Bot rarely attack their target directly, instead opting to support their master from the bench with healing, stat boosts, and other assistive measures.  Despite lacking a visible mouth, these support mecha still manage to convey a tale of sadness through their eyes.",
