Now, in all fairness, beyond his amphibian physique, Toad Man fulfills his agricultural purpose with the utmost efficiency, due to his Rain Flush equipment. He begins by rocketing a pod of vapor into the sky, which evidently forms into a shower of rain drops to assuage crop droughts; in times of combat, he utilizes acidic rain instead, benign to humans yet absolutely devastating for any robot's armor. Of course, as a toad-themed robot, his jumping prowess is something to behold, and has earned a long-jumping position in Russia's Robot Olympics team. Toad Man has also furthered his agricultural dedication by researching and experimenting with natural sciences, but most of all he has a fond appreciation of all types of music! ...Of course, his appreciation is unknowingly hindered due to the fact he's tone-deaf! But, even with his poor hearing, Toad Man's an absolute crowd controller on the battlefield, keeping waves of threatening robots away with his killer Rain Flush. Well, that, or maybe no one wants to get near that weird, slimy frog-skin of his...?",
