A red streak star, he was born to thrill \u2013 literally, of course, given that his chassis is outfitted with a permutable wheel set-up and makeshift engine. He even has little handlebars to steer! Eventually, at some point, Nitro Man wanted to step up his stunt game \u2013 so he had the stunt department outfit him with his Wheel Cutter ability to let him pull off some really cool wall-climbing stunts! It\u2019s easy to gleam, but Nitro Man\u2019s a full-blown daredevil. It doesn\u2019t matter the feat, you can count on Nitro Man being the one to put his neck out and get that take. Granted, given he\u2019s a robot, any death-defying stunt just lands him in the mechanic\u2019s for a week\u2026 but it does make it tough to get insured! Notably, Nitro Man is also the acting president of a robot stunt club running sixty members strong. Just recently, they\u2019d been campaigning for stronger union guarantees and more paid sick days after Nitro Man had been let go on Roboenza-leave. His attitude to battle is the same as his stunts; hit the throttle and don\u2019t look back! His safety comes last! And unfortunately, yours probably does too.",
