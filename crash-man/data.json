While at first glance he may appear rather clumsy, Crash Man's adept at causing large-scale damage with all sorts of explosives, his favorite being his very own Crash Bomber. To be quite frank, Crash Man's likely to destroy stuff even if he isn't asked to. That being said, he's an obedient robot who's willing to help out Dr. Wily whenever needed .... If he's in a good mood, that is. While a majority of the time Crash Man can be docile, he can easily be thrown into a trigger-happy rage where he can end up causing thousands in property damage. Because of this, Dr. Wily tends to keep Crash Man on a short leash within a controllable environment. With his temper and his Crash Bomber, however, Crash Man is an invaluable asset on the battlefield, if only because chances are there'll be nothing left on it once he's finished. Now if only he could figure out how to pick things up with his hands....",
