    "robot_description2": "After four miserably failed attempts at world domination, Dr. Wily decided he needed to approach his goals at a new angle. Mega Man was completely tricked by Dr. Wily's scheme using Dr. Cossack, but he thought he could possibly improve that facade by disguising the true menace as someone familiar, but still with personal conflicts... like Proto Man! To make a copy of the red bomber that could hold its own in battle, Dr. Wily needed to create a new design of robots, thus creating the Dark Man series! Dark Man 1 is a version of the normal Dark Man schematic, but with a stronger arm cannon and tank treads. This war-like redesign was made so Dark Man 1 could be the first line of defense for \"Proto Man's\" castle. The powered up arm cannon has no new bells, whistles, or gimmicks. Instead, Dark Man 1's uniqueness lies in his mobility. Although leaving him unable to jump, Dark Man 1's tank treads allow him to move faster, at a steadier pace, and more stable than his fellow Dark brethren. He seems to greatly lose control whenever his treads are dampened, however, so this can be a weak spot to exploit.",
