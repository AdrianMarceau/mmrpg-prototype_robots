    "robot_description2": "For many years, Blade Man served dutifully as the cutting-edge guide and guardian at a historic castle site. The current lord of the castle, by all accounts a reported fanatic of all things swordsmanship-related, had Blade Man built in order to elegantly fuse the practices of the past with the many refinements afforded by the future. This luxurious background gave Blade Man the opportunity to truly fall in love with the sharp art of armaments, delivering him his purpose and drive in life. Unfortunately, during the Roboenza epidemic, Blade Man became one of the earliest documented cases, and in his sickened frenzy overtook and ravaged the castle he was meant to safeguard. Despite not necessarily being designed for combat, as a robot whose hands could carve a turkey in two, it wasn\u2019t particularly hard for him to adapt; Blade Man used his acute appendages to rapidly cover ground all over the castle. Of course, he was also quite knowledgeable in sword-fighting and in performance impalement arts, which was terrifying when paired with his signature Triple Blade ability, a volley of piercing miniature blades. Blade Man was eventually quelled, cured, and allowed to return to work, though not without a lot of legal contention from the World Robot Union, who contested the safety of Blade Man\u2019s design in a workplace setting. He was only somewhat dubiously cleared after the castle lord argued that Blade Man\u2019s mania was technically historically significant to the castle, and he needed to be maintained as an important figure to the site. This was a joy for Blade Man anyway, as he could return to lecturing tourists and sightseers once again to his heart\u2019s content; Blade Man\u2019s known to be a bit of a nerd when it comes to swords, and his passionate ramblings have confused and lost many jetlagged travelers. Just don\u2019t get him started when it comes to new-era technology weapons like the busters \u2013 he\u2019ll tell you all about how a proper gentleman would never use those! When it comes time to fight, don\u2019t think he\u2019s dumb in bringing a sword to a gunfight; otherwise, you\u2019ll be the one picking up the pieces!",
